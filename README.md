# FreecellSolitaire
Code for a game of FreeCell solitaire.
The model uses an interface ICard and an interface IPile to represent cards and piles in a game of freecell, respectively.  
The model is able to start the game, move cards, and tell if the game is over (on a high level).
The controller is meant to get input from the user in order to determine where cards should be moved.
The view is meant to represent the game visually for the user after each move they make.
